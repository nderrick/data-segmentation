# data-segmentation
Cluster and classify data using K-Means and UMAP

# Objectives

Use K-Means and UMAP along with `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and `purrr` to create a visualization that identifies subgroups in data. You will specifically apply:

- Modeling: `kmeans()` and `umap()`
- Iteration: `purrr`
- Data Manipulation: `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `tibble`
- Visualization: `ggplot2` (bonus `plotly`)
